## Local Authority Page

- Start with a modal pop-up with information, telling you how to use the tool

- Initially load point data of each park in the area
    - Maybe some details of the parks? An info box
    - Very simple, just one point per park
    - Allow zooming/movement etc.
- Then, exlusively load in one park's data
- Zoom to this area, center the catchment area in the viewport

- Then each individual measure/dataset: should each of these have their own pop-up? 
    - Is this another pop-up tab that opens, with a legend, and a "learn more" link that will open a modal?
