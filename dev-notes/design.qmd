This is a record of decisions and information informing the design of the dashboard.

- Reduce cognitive load: simplify, give the information room to breath
- Visual hierarchy: make it obvious what is primary vs. secondary data
    - Navigation: where to click first?
- Useful search, sensible navigation and zoom

Maybe put all the info in a single toggle menu?

### Optimisation

- Gradual loading: only load as needed. Can look at specifically only loading to a view port/catchement area.
- Zoom levels: ensure to group as you zoom out; don't render individual points.
